README
Overview - JS with Rails Project/Flatiron School/ J. Gladstone

The project expands upon my previous Rails project assessment. The project goal is to add dynamic features to the previous Rails application with the use of JavaScript and a JSON API. Specifications can be found in the spec.md file.

The application is for a Luxury Day Spa which allows clients to sign up and book appointments with staff members for a variety of services.


I have added seed data for testing and used basic css for styling.

To install this app, follow these steps:

Fork and clone the repository, run bundle install, rake db:migrate, rake db:seed, rails s and open browser to localhost:3000.
