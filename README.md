README
Overview - JS with Rails Project/Flatiron School/ J. Gladstone

The project is a modification of the previous Rails Backend Project. This project implements the use of JavaScript as a Frontend API component. Specifications can be found in the spec.md file.

The application is for a Luxury Day Spa which allows clients to sign up and book appointments with staff members for certain services.


I have added seed data for testing and used basic css for styling.

To install this app, follow these steps:

Fork and clone the repository, run bundle install, rake db:migrate, rake db:seed, rails s and open browser to localhost:3000.

This project has been licensed under the MIT open source license.

# May 2019 - This application is being modified to include some implementations of using a JS frontend to show use of AJAX and rendering with JSON.
